          <h2 className="font-bold text-[20px] sm:text-[30px] mt-1" id='section6'>CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF EFFECTIVE STEM EDUCATION</h2>


          <h2 className="font-bold text-[16px] sm:text-[24px] mt-1" id='section7'>
            Interdisciplinary:
          </h2>
          <p className="text-[14px] lg:text-[16px] mt-2 sm:mt-2">
            The essence of STEM education is incorporating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics into one uniform learning paradigm. The interdisciplinary approach encourages students to see connections in these areas. They can then use this amalgamated knowledge to solve real, complex issues.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-bold text-[16px] sm:text-[24px] mt-1" id='section8'>
            Hands-on Learning:
            :
          </h2>
          <p className="text-[14px] lg:text-[16px] mt-2 sm:mt-2">
            Experiential learning is the rockbed of STEM education. Experiential learning in the form of laboratory experiments, engineering projects, and coding exercises—all these are provided to students so that they get practical experience in implementing theoretical concepts.</p>
          <h2 className="font-bold text-[16px] sm:text-[24px] mt-1" id='section9'>
            Inquiry-based Learning:
          </h2>
          <p className="text-[14px] lg:text-[16px] mt-2 sm:mt-2">
            Being a student able to ask questions and, through experiments and research, understand how you go about finding answers goes further in the aspect of conceptualization. This aspect brings about curiosity and independence in thought; these are the skills required for future innovators. Technology in classrooms—coding software, robotic kits, virtual laboratories—is one modern way. Such technology may be helpful for students to learn more interactively. The familiarity of this tool keeps the student updated, and in this way, they can meet the technology requirements in the job market.
